requirements.txt
For this basic script, there are no external libraries, so requirements.txt can be:

# No external dependencies required for this project.
This still satisfies the convention that requirements.txt exists even when only the Python standard library is used.

For this particular project, the `requirements.txt` file can be very simple because you only use core Python (no external libraries).[5]

Use one of these two options:

### Option 1: Comment-only file (simplest for beginners)

No external dependencies required for this project.


This clearly tells that the project runs with just standard Python and nothing needs to be installed with `pip`.

### Option 2: Explicitly state Python version (a bit more formal)

 No external third‑party packages required.
Project uses core Python 3.
